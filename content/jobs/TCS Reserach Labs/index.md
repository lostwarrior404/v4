- Studied the dynamics and network structure of the Reddit social media network by using
  data collected over a year.
- Analysis was done on distributed technologies such as Hadoop.
- My work involved writing distributed algorithms in Hadoop to reduce the analysis run
  time(from days to a few hours) and statistical analysis of results in R.
